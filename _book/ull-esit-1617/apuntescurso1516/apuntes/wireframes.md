## Wireframes

A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen
blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework
of a website.

Wireframes are created for the purpose of
arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. 

The
purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a
creative idea. 

The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement
of the websiteâ€™s content, including interface elements and navigational
systems, and how they work together.

The wireframe usually
lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus
lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content.


In other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks
like.


Wireframes can be pencil drawings or sketches on a
whiteboard, or they can be produced by means of a broad array of
free or commercial software applications. 


Wireframes are generally
created by business analysts, user experience designers, developers,
visual designers and other roles with expertise in interaction
design, information architecture and user research.
