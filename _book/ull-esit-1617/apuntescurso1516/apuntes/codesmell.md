### Definición de *Code Smell* de la Wikipedia:

According to Martin Fowler, *"a **code smell** is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system"*. 

Smells are certain structures in the code that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality. 

Code smells **are usually not bugs**. They are not technically incorrect and do not currently prevent the program from functioning. Instead, **they indicate weaknesses in design** that may be slowing down development or increasing the risk of bugs or failures in the future.

### Clasificación de Code Smells
#### Application-level smells:
* **Duplicated code:** identical or very similar code exists in more than one location.
* **Contrived complexity:** forced usage of overcomplicated design patterns where simpler design would suffice.

#### Class-level smells:
* **Large class:** a class that has grown too large. See God object.
* **Feature envy:** a class that uses methods of another class excessively.
* **Inappropriate intimacy:** a class that has dependencies on implementation details of another class.
* **Refused bequest:** a class that overrides a method of a base class in such a way that the contract of the base class is not honored by the derived class. See Liskov substitution principle.
* **Lazy class / Freeloader:** a class that does too little.
* **Excessive use of literals:** these should be coded as named constants, to improve readability and to avoid programming errors. Additionally, literals can and should be externalized into resource files/scripts where possible, to facilitate localization of software if it is intended to be deployed in different regions.
* **Cyclomatic complexity:** too many branches or loops; this may indicate a function needs to be broken up into smaller functions, or that it has potential for simplification.
* **Downcasting:** a type cast which breaks the abstraction model; the abstraction may have to be refactored or eliminated.
* **Orphan Variable or Constant class:** a class that typically has a collection of constants which belong elsewhere (typically a problem when using a Constants class ) where those constants should be owned by one of the other member classes.

#### Method-level smells:
* **Too many parameters:** a long list of parameters is hard to read, and makes calling and testing the function complicated. It may indicate that the purpose of the function is ill-conceived and that the code should be refactored so responsibility is assigned in a more clean-cut way.
* **Long method:** a method, function, or procedure that has grown too large.
* **Excessively long identifiers:** in particular, the use of naming conventions to provide disambiguation that should be implicit in the software architecture.
* **Excessively short identifiers:** the name of a variable should reflect its function unless the function is obvious.
* **Excessive return of data:** a function or method that returns more than what each of its callers needs.
