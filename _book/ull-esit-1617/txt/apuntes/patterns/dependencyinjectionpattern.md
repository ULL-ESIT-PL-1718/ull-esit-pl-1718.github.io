## Dependency Injection Pattern

The dependencies of components being provided as input by a external entity

* Each dependency is received from the outside (instead of being hardcoded into the module)
* This means the module can be reused in different contexts

Dependency injection is a software design pattern in which one or more dependencies (or services) are injected, or passed by reference, into a dependent object.
